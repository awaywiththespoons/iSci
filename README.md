# iSci

Design for iSci logo. 

logo.pde is the basic verison
logo_function.pde is a "function" verison, with 3x data sets

to do:
* add data sets
* add buttons to toggle betweem (i.e. up arrow to toggle between a larger number of sets)
* sort out text to label each graph (couldn't get the Y location of text right)
